Roar of Narnia
=======

This is a mod made for fans of The Chronicles of Narnia series written by C.S. Lewis. Play through the books within
Minecraft.

Installation
=======

1. Git clone the repository
2. Create a new project with IntelliJ using the build.gradle.kts
3. Wait for IntelliJ to finish importing the project, and then use the auto-generated launch configurations to run the
   game.

If at any point you are missing libraries in your IDE, or you've run into problems you can
run `gradlew --refresh-dependencies` to refresh the local cache. `gradlew clean` to reset everything
{this does not affect your code} and then start the process again.

Credit
=======

All credit for the idea goes to C.S. Lewis and his "The Chronicles of Narnia" book series.
